        <p class="paragraph">
          We are two students from HTL Leonding named Andrei Stana and Kyaw Htet Htun.
          This project reflects our passion for gaming and programming and this is why we want to prove what we can do in it.
          The quality is the most important thing for us and that is why we try to watch every small detail out.

        <p class="idea-txt">
          Imagine you want to play something after a long school or work day and you don't have any idea with whom you should play cause your friends are busy or you don't have any.
          Here is where we come in action. We want to develop a platform where gamers can create online parties and those who are searching for parties can see them in a feed.
          Aside from that we want to implement different party functionalities like tournament mode to make sure you have fun on our platform or a premium function where you can customize your account to show your friends how cool you are or to define your personality.
        </p>
        <p class="goal-txt">
          We want to make gaming and online socializing easier and funnier than ever. We also want to support people who want to start a career in e-sports as server owners and average gamers.
